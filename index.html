        <h2>IC 1318 (Gamma Cygni Nebula Complex)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/ic1318.jpg" alt="IC 1318">
        <p>IC 1318 constitutes a vast H II region complex within Cygnus X, ionized primarily by the O-type multiple system γ Cygni and associated OB associations. Multi-epoch Fabry-Pérot observations reveal split [N II] and Hα profiles indicative of expanding supershells and champagne flows, with kinematic evidence of radiative-driven implosion triggering sequential star formation along dense photodissociation ridges.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>IC 727 (Spiral Galaxy in Leo)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/ic727.jpg" alt="IC 727">
        <p>IC 727 is a late-type spiral galaxy exhibiting loosely wound arms and modest surface brightness. Integrated spectroscopy suggests low current star formation efficiency, with potential minor merger remnants in the outer disk; its field environment limits strong tidal perturbations, preserving relatively quiescent rotational dynamics.</p>

        <h2>Messier 101 (Pinwheel Galaxy, NGC 5457)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/m101.jpg" alt="M101">
        <p>Messier 101 exemplifies an asymmetric grand-design spiral perturbed by satellite interactions, yielding elevated star formation rates (~3–5 M⊙ yr⁻¹) concentrated in giant H II complexes. Multiwavelength mapping reveals tidal HI streamers, warped outer disks, and a rich population of recent core-collapse supernovae tracing density-wave amplified starburst episodes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Messier 106 (NGC 4258)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/m106.jpg" alt="M106">
        <p>Messier 106 hosts a Seyfert 2/LINER nucleus with precisely measured megamaser emission tracing a thin, warped Keplerian disk around a (3.9 ± 0.1) × 10⁷ M⊙ black hole. Anomalous spiral arms align with jet-driven shocks, while near-nuclear starburst and multi-phase outflows manifest complex feedback kinematics.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Messier 13 (Great Hercules Cluster, NGC 6205) with IC 4617</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/m13_ic4617.jpg" alt="M13 and IC 4617">
        <p>Messier 13 is a core-collapsed Oosterhoff type I globular cluster exhibiting multiple stellar populations with pronounced light-element anticorrelations from AGB self-enrichment. The distant background Sbc spiral IC 4617 (~553 Mly) appears projected nearby, revealing regular rotation and minimal bulge dominance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Messier 51a (Whirlpool Galaxy, NGC 5194)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/m51.jpg" alt="M51">
        <p>Messier 51a undergoes a major interaction with NGC 5195, generating classical tidal arms and density waves that amplify star formation along spiral shocks. IFU spectroscopy discloses inflow along tidal bridges, disrupted metallicity gradients, and enhanced nuclear Seyfert activity driven by radial gas transport.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Messier 57 (Ring Nebula, NGC 6720) with IC 1296</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/m57_ic1296.jpg" alt="M57 and IC 1296">
        <p>Messier 57 is a poly-polar planetary nebula with high-excitation knots and low-ionization microstructures shaped by collimated outflows from a hot [WC8] central star. The projected barred spiral IC 1296 (~238 Mly) displays bar-resonant patterns and low surface brightness, offering minimal foreground extinction.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Messier 63 (Sunflower Galaxy, NGC 5055)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/m63.jpg" alt="M63">
        <p>Messier 63 exhibits flocculent multi-arm structure sustained by local gravitational instabilities rather than global density waves. Its smooth rotation curve and moderate star formation efficiency reflect dynamical quiescence, with HI observations indicating a symmetric extended disk.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>NGC 6339 (Barred Spiral in Hercules)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/ngc6339.jpg" alt="NGC 6339">
        <p>NGC 6339 is an SBcd barred spiral displaying open arms and weak central concentration. Recent MEGARA IFU data reveal kinematic misalignment between bar and disk major axes, suggestive of secular evolution or minor accretion in an isolated environment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>NGC 6888 (Crescent Nebula)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/ngc6888.jpg" alt="NGC 6888">
        <p>NGC 6888 is a nitrogen-enriched wind-blown bubble sculpted by the WN6 star WR 136, with filamentary shocks exhibiting Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and radiative cooling. Spectroscopic diagnostics indicate potential triggered massive star formation along compressed shell interfaces.</p>

        <h2>NGC 7331 (Unbarred Spiral in the Deer Lick Group)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/ngc7331.jpg" alt="NGC 7331">
        <p>NGC 7331 serves as a nearby analog to the Milky Way, featuring a classical bulge and prominent dust lane obscuring a low-luminosity AGN. CO mapping reveals central molecular gas depletion and a steeply rising rotation curve indicative of a massive dark matter halo.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>NGC 7635 (Bubble Nebula)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/ngc7635.jpg" alt="NGC 7635">
        <p>NGC 7635 is a canonical stellar wind bubble energized by the O6.5If runaway star BD+60°2522, with proper-motion measured expansion into an adjacent molecular cloud producing photoevaporative flows and pillar structures via radiative implosion.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>NGC 891 (Edge-on Spiral in Andromeda)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/ngc891.jpg" alt="NGC 891">
        <p>NGC 891 provides an archetypal edge-on view of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas and thick-disk kinematics, with vertical velocity lags and halo rotation consistent with galactic fountain circulation and minor merger-driven outflows.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>NGC 925 (Late-type Barred Spiral)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/ngv925.jpg" alt="NGC 925">
        <p>NGC 925 is an SABcd barred spiral with asymmetric outer arms potentially induced by past flybys within the local group environment. Extensive HI mapping reveals low central gas concentration and extended neutral disk characteristic of Magellanic-type systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Sh2-101 (Tulip Nebula)</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/irislabs/main/sh2-101.jpg" alt="Sh2-101">
        <p>Sh2-101 is a compact H II region ionized by the O9V star HD 227018, featuring bright rims and elephant-trunk globules formed by radiative feedback. PDR spectroscopy indicates sequential triggered star formation along ionization fronts within the Cygnus rift molecular complex.</p>
