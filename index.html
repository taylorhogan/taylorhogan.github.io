        <h2>IC 1318 – The Gamma Cygni Nebula</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/taylorhogan.github.io/main/images/ic1318.jpg" alt="IC 1318 – The Gamma Cygni Nebula">
        <p>IC 1318 is a vast emission nebula complex in the constellation Cygnus, centered around the bright star Gamma Cygni (Sadr). This region features intricate filaments of ionized hydrogen glowing in H-alpha light, interspersed with dark dust lanes that create a striking contrast often referred to as the Butterfly Nebula in wide-field views. As part of the Cygnus OB association, it represents an active star-forming region where massive stars energize the surrounding gas.</p>
        <p>The nebula lies approximately 5,000 light-years from Earth. The photons captured in this image departed the nebula around 3,000 BCE, during the early Bronze Age. At that time on Earth, the first urban civilizations were emerging in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, while monumental architecture such as the early Egyptian pyramids was under construction.</p>

        <h2>Messier 101 – The Pinwheel Galaxy</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/taylorhogan.github.io/main/images/m101.jpg" alt="Messier 101 – The Pinwheel Galaxy">
        <p>Messier 101, commonly known as the Pinwheel Galaxy, is a face-on grand-design spiral galaxy in Ursa Major. Its asymmetric appearance and prominent star-forming regions result from past gravitational interactions with companion galaxies, producing vivid H II regions and young star clusters visible along its sweeping arms.</p>
        <p>At a distance of about 21 million light-years, the photons in this image began their journey during the early Miocene epoch. Around 21 million years ago on Earth, the ancestors of modern great apes were diverging, extensive grasslands were spreading across continents, and early members of the horse and elephant lineages were evolving.</p>

        <h2>Messier 13 (Hercules Globular Cluster) and IC 4617</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorhogan/taylorhogan.github.io/main/images/m13_ic4617.jpg" alt="Messier 13 and IC 4617">
        <p>Messier 13 is one of the brightest globular clusters in the northern sky, containing several hundred thousand stars in a dense spherical distribution within the Milky Way's halo. This image also captures the faint background spiral galaxy IC 4617, visible near the cluster—a distant extragalactic object unrelated to M13.</p>
        <p>M13 lies about 22,000 light-years away, so its light departed during the Last Glacial Maximum, when vast ice sheets covered much of the northern hemisphere and early modern humans were creating cave art in Europe. In contrast, IC 4617 is approximately 480 million light-years distant; its photons left during the Cambrian period, when complex multicellular life was rapidly diversifying in Earth's oceans.</p>
